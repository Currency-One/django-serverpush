# django-serverpush

This is a server push solution highly integrated with django and based on [hookbox](http://hookbox.org).

Right now it's only available as a demo project (you can just copy the app).
Documentation and install script are to come.

If you encounter any problems or have some questions about it please don't hesitate to contact me via #hookbox irc channel or some other method listed [here](http://ziga.hamsworld.net/about/).
